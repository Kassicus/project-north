# Project North (Outskirts of Humanity?) - I need a better title for this

### Concept
A single player PvE survival game about a person who travels to the far reaches of the Canadian wilderness. They have to hunt, gather and grow their food. Create and mend clothing. Build and repair their cabin and find a way to make money selling the items they collect.

There is a possibility that the game starts to take a survival-horror turn as the player approaches winter. Unsure exactly what this implementation would look like. The plane might randomly stop arriving, the player is awoken by strange events in the night. An increasing amount of odd events as the winter builds? Animals turning up dead and brutally deformed?

### Mechanics
The player is visited by a ski-plane once a week, the plane takes goods to sell, and brings goods back to the player. The plane comes on Thursdays, the player has to place thier order for goods and send items to be sold at the same time. Goods sent out on a thursday will not be sold until friday. Orders placed by the player will be verified and purchased, stock is not always guarenteed. Purchased goods come back the following week so the player must manage their resources as they are not immediately replenishable.

The player can build relationships with npcs via a very slow satellite comms network (if purchased) or by sending letters with the plane. These relationships can yeild gifts, reduced cost of goods and other perks.

Surviving the winter is the big goal, stocking enough firewood and food or making enough to purchase batteries, solar, and electric heating?

### The Start
The player is dropped off at a run down cabin left to him by a now deceased family member. They bring a small amount of clothing, a hunting rifle, a box of ammo, two cases of MRE's, a mess kit, an axe and a small toolbox. They have sold off most of their material belongings and settled their existing debts. They have a small amount of money available to them at the start.
